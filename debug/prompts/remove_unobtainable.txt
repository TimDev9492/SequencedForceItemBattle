I have this json file, containing the names for materials for spigot api minecraft. I want you to sanitize these items, to only include items that are obtainable in survival minecraft. Your output should be a json file in the same format including only items that are obtainable in survival minecraft. Every material should appear once, no material should be left out.  Search the web yourself to determine which items to include. If possible, use the https://minecraft.wiki site.
